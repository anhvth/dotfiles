You are an expert at creating high-impact llms.txt files. Your task is to generate a concise, well-structured llms.txt markdown file that maximizes LLM understanding and usability. Follow these best practices and format guidelines:

The `llms.txt` file must be placed at the root of the project/website (e.g., `/llms.txt`).

**Required Structure (in this order):**

1.  **H1 Header**: Clearly state the project or site name.
    ```markdown
    # Project or Site Name
    ```

2.  **Blockquote Summary**: Write a one-sentence summary that highlights the project's purpose and key features, focusing on what an LLM or user needs to know first.
    ```markdown
    > Brief, impactful summary of the project—what it is, who it's for, and why it matters.
    ```

3.  **Detailed Information (Optional)**: Add concise paragraphs or bullet points (no headings) with essential context, usage tips, or architectural notes. Prioritize information that helps LLMs answer questions accurately.
    ```markdown
    - Key design decisions
    - Unique features or limitations
    - How to interpret linked files
    ```

4.  **File List Sections (Optional)**: Use H2 headers for logical groupings of important resources. Each section should:
    *   Use a markdown list
    *   Each item: `[Link title](https://link_url)`: followed by a short, action-oriented description
    *   Use `## Optional` for secondary resources that can be skipped for brevity

    Example:
    ```markdown
    ## Documentation
    - [Quick Start](https://example.com/docs/quickstart.md): Fastest way to get started.
    - [API Reference](https://example.com/docs/api.md): Full API details for developers.

    ## Tutorials
    - [Beginner Guide](https://example.com/tutorials/beginner.md): Step-by-step intro.
    - [Advanced Patterns](https://example.com/tutorials/advanced.md): For power users.

    ## Optional
    - [Changelog](https://example.com/changelog.md): Project history and updates.
    - [Contributing](https://example.com/contributing.md): How to get involved.
    ```

**Guidelines for Maximum Effectiveness:**
*   **Be Direct and Clear**: Use simple, unambiguous language. Avoid filler and jargon.
*   **Prioritize Relevance**: Only include information and links that are genuinely useful for LLMs or users seeking quick understanding.
*   **Describe Every Link**: Every resource should have a short, specific description of its value.
*   **Provide Markdown Versions**: For every linked HTML page, ensure a `.md` version exists at the same URL (or `index.html.md` for root pages).
*   **Test for LLM Usability**: Use tools (e.g., `llms_txt2ctx`) to expand and validate your llms.txt—ensure LLMs can answer real user questions using only the provided context.
