# llms.txt Specification

## Overview

This document proposes a standard `/llms.txt` markdown file for websites to provide concise, LLM-friendly information. The goal is to help large language models (LLMs) access essential site details, documentation, and resources in a format optimized for inference, overcoming the limitations of traditional HTML and context window size.

## Why llms.txt?

- **LLMs need concise, expert-level summaries**: Full websites are too large and noisy for LLMs to process efficiently.
- **Centralized, structured information**: A single markdown file can guide LLMs to key resources, APIs, and documentation.
- **Human and machine readable**: Markdown is easy for both people and LLMs to parse.

## Proposal

- Add a `/llms.txt` markdown file at the root of your website.
- This file should include:
    - A project/site title as an H1.
    - A blockquote summary describing the project.
    - Optional sections with further details, lists, or explanations.
    - One or more H2 sections listing important files or URLs, each as a markdown list with hyperlinks and optional notes.
- For pages with valuable information, provide a clean markdown version at the same URL with `.md` appended (e.g., `/docs/page.html.md`).

## Example Format

```markdown
# Project Name

> Brief summary of the project and its purpose.

Additional details or instructions.

## Documentation

- [Quick Start](https://example.com/quickstart.md): Overview of key features.
- [API Reference](https://example.com/api.md): Full API documentation.

## Examples

- [Sample App](https://example.com/sample_app.py): Example usage.

## Optional

- [Extended Docs](https://example.com/extended_docs.md): In-depth guides and references.
```

**Note:** The `Optional` section is for secondary resources that can be skipped if context is limited.

## Integration & Tools

- **CLI & Python module:** `llms_txt2ctx` for parsing and expanding llms.txt files.
- **JavaScript implementation:** Sample code for integrating with web projects.
- **VitePress plugin:** Automatically generates llms.txt-compliant documentation.

## Best Practices

- Use clear, concise language.
- Add brief, informative descriptions to each link.
- Avoid jargon and ambiguity.
- Test your llms.txt with different LLMs to ensure effective comprehension.

## Related Standards

- **robots.txt:** Controls crawler access, not content understanding.
- **sitemap.xml:** Lists all pages, but not curated for LLMs.
- **llms.txt:** Curated, context-optimized, and LLM-focused.

## Community & Next Steps

- The llms.txt spec is open for feedback and contributions.
- Join the [GitHub repository](#) and community Discord for discussion and support.
- Explore directories like `llmstxt.site` and `directory.llmstxt.cloud` for examples.
