# Dotfiles Documentation

This folder keeps living documentation for the dotfiles refactor project. Start here to understand the current state, desired end state, and operational runbooks.

- `baseline.md` captures the environment snapshot used as a safety net before making changes.
- `refactor-roadmap.md` describes the phased modernization plan.
- `rollback.md` explains how to revert or disable pieces of the new stack safely.

Every time the configuration changes in a meaningful way, update these documents to keep them in sync with reality.
