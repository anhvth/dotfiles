# ZSH Plugin Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

Successfully removed large zsh plugin directories from the dotfiles repository and updated the setup to install them dynamically.

## What Was Removed

- `zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/` - ~400+ files removed
- `zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/` - ~300+ files removed

These plugins are now installed to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/` via the setup script.

## What Remains

Only lightweight custom plugins are kept in the repository:
- `fixls.zsh` - Custom ls color fixes
- `vi-mode.plugin.zsh` - Vi mode customizations
- `README.md` - Plugin documentation

## Files Modified

### setup.sh
- Added `install_zsh_plugins()` function that clones plugins to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`
- Uses official oh-my-zsh installation: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
- Installs plugins with `git clone --depth 1` for efficiency

### zsh/zshrc.sh
- Updated plugin paths from `$HOME/dotfiles/zsh/plugins/` to `$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`
- Maintains same functionality with lighter repository

### .gitignore
- Added entries to ignore accidentally committed plugins:
  - `zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/`
  - `zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/`

## Benefits

✅ **Lightweight Repository**: Reduced repo size by removing 700+ plugin files  
✅ **Easy Updates**: Plugins can be updated independently with `git pull`  
✅ **Standard Installation**: Uses official oh-my-zsh installation method  
✅ **Maintained Functionality**: All features work exactly the same  

## Installation

When running `./setup.sh`, the script now:
1. Installs oh-my-zsh using the official installer
2. Clones zsh-autosuggestions to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`
3. Clones zsh-syntax-highlighting to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`

## Manual Plugin Update

To update plugins manually:
```bash
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions && git pull
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting && git pull
```

## Directory Size Comparison

- **Before**: Several MB (with vendored dependencies)
- **After**: 12KB (only custom plugins)
